I am trained as a mathematician (Ph.D., 2009) and currently work as a Machine Learning Architect specializing in
business applications of statistics and ML. I enjoy partnering with businesses to strategically leverage their data. 

This is my blog so you'll find a lot of my personal ramblings on mathematics, machine learning, statistics, and
functional programming. None of them necessarily represent the views of my employers (past or present). My social links
are below if you'd like to reach out.
