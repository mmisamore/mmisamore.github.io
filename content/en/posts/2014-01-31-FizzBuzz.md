[FizzBuzz](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest) is a fun little exercise for
thinking about conditional statements. The Haskell versions over there
were not quite the way I did it, so I figured I'd post a solution here:

```haskell
f x = if null fizzbuzz then show x else fizzbuzz
   where fizz     = if x `mod` 3 == 0 then "Fizz" else ""
         buzz     = if x `mod` 5 == 0 then "Buzz" else ""
         fizzbuzz = fizz ++ buzz

main = putStr . unlines $ map f [1..100]
```

The central point is that a separate case for 15 is unnecessary: the effects of
this program are expressed in the `String` monoid so we can almost pretend we
are writing as we would in the imperative case. We accumulate the intended
effects and then print the output as a side-effect of evaluating "main".

Yes, I should have used `ByteString` or `Text` or whatever, but this is FizzBuzz
we are talking about. High-performance and/or parallel FizzBuzz is left as an
exercise. :wink:
